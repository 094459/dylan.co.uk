      <p class="mainlink">By December Karen was getting better but still not completely 
        over her ordeal - she still had a gall bladder which was causing her problems 
        (including being re-admitted to hospital later on), and she had contracted 
        MRSA as well as having pneumonia! The MRSA was especially harrowing as 
        it meant restrictions on seeing Dylan, so the nurses kept Polaroid's of 
        her. Dylan was now off the respirator but still on aided breathing - he 
        was put on a course of <a href="http://www.pennhealth.com/ency/article/001916.htm" target="_blank" class="mainlink">CPAP</a>, 
        and had to spend a certain amount of time with breathing apparatus strapped 
        to his head, which he (often) managed to remove.</p>

      <p>Over November we got to know the little baby in the next incubator, also 
        called Dylan. Not only that, but he was born an hour before our Dylan, 
        at the same age (28 weeks). We found this coincidence strange, and they 
        kepy happening (both grandmothers coming from Tipararee in Ireland for 
        example). </p>

      <p class="related">Recovery...</p>
      <p>Towards the end of November mum was getting a lot better but still poorly. 
        She now had to have an operation to remove the offending gall bladder, 
        which we were all apprehensive about. Dylan was getting better, but we 
        also had a few scares - we were warned before hand that the first few 
        weeks are very up and down, and they were not wrong! One day he would 
        look good and be a little alert, then he would look very tired, sickly 
        and have a temperature - we coped as best we could but it was emotionally 
        very difficult.</p>

      <p>We were told by the senior paedratition that Dylan had a couple of issues 
        that they needed to look at closely. Firstly, during the birth he had 
        suffered bleeding in his brain which was causing fluid to build up and 
        swell the ventricles of the brain. They sat down with us and tried to 
        explain the best they could what it all meant and what the chances were....it 
        was probably one of the hardest things we have both been put through....</p>

      <p align="left" class="related">Kangaroo Care...</p>
      <p align="left">Even though Dylan is so small, the nurses in the neo natal 
        unit encouraged us to help with his &quot;cares&quot; (changing, cleaning, 
        feeding, etc) and to cuddle him by taking our shirts off and giving him 
        skin to skin contact, or as its called in the trade, <a href="http://www.prematurity.org/baby/kangaroo.html" target="_blank" class="mainlink">Kangaroo 
        care</a>. With him being so small, we were very timid initially, as he 
        seemed SO tiny and SO fragile, but eventually we became more confident. 
        The scary part was unhooking, unclipping all his cables and making sure 
        they weren't tangled as we took him out or put him back....</p>
