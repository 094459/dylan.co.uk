      <p class="related">Going to church....</p>
      <p>After finally settling down into a semi routine, Dylan sleeping through 
        the night and mum and dad finally finding some time to recoup - believe 
        you me, you never know how good a full nights sleep is until you go without 
        for a number of months! </p>
      <p>After donning his specially tailored church suit (all the way from the 
        spanish relies), we arrived early so we could feed him before mass. Unfortunately, 
        it clashes with one of his feeds - however, the 10:30 mass we have been 
        told is child friendly, and so we are looking forward to making lots of 
        noise and causing a general disturbance.</p>

      <p>The day went really well. We met Father Kevin after mass (it had been 
        a LONG time since mum and dad had entered the hallowed halls, and it was 
        actually a not so bad experience - fully attended, with altar 'girls' 
        and lots of singing and involvement) and went to the social club and were 
        introduced to members of the local community.</p>
      <p class="related">The Weekend off - another visit to Lymington</p>
      <p>We took Dylan to see Lolo and Lola again, as well as his aunts, uncles 
        and cousins. This gave mum and dad the opportunity to sneak off for some 
        quiet time in Christchurch harbour.</p>
      <p class="blktext" align="center">Errr, mum. What are you doing on my swing?</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/may03-dylan03.jpg" width="340" height="255"> 
      </p>
      <p>It had only been a few weeks since lolo and lola had seen Dylan, but 
        he grows so much and so quickly. In May, he reached 15lb, and is above 
        average for his corrected age - fantastic!</p>
      <p class="blktext" align="center">So, as i was saying.....</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/may03-dylan04.jpg" width="340" height="255"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/may03-dylan05.jpg" width="340" height="255"></p>
      <p>As you can see, he looks quite at home chatting to lolo - at last, someone 
        who speaks his language.</p>
      <p class="related">Chilling out in Whitstable</p>
      <p>In May, mum and dad got me some new accessories for my pushchair - a 
        foot muff. It was interesting watching dad try and put it together, so 
        it was left to mum to figure it out......I don't know how I managed without 
        it, and am thrilled at being able to lose countless socks and other items 
        in the further reaches of the foot muff ...</p>
      <p class="blktext" align="center">Let me see what i have down here today.....</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/may03-dylan06.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
      <p>I have already established my position on the comfy sofas, although I 
        need some time to grow into these seats....</p>
      <p class="blktext" align="center">Hello..</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/may03-dylan07.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
      <p>I have some new toys delivered, although i am not really sure about some 
        of them. The converted wash basket (apparantly, a la mode in the creches 
        of Paris) was a bit of a let down, but the parachute trainer was fun, 
        although I don't think I am ready for static lines yet...</p>
