      <p class="related">The beginning...</p>
      <p>On October 24th, 2002,in the middle of chaos and problems, an amazing 
        thing happened to us: Dylan was born.</p>
      <p>At exactly 00:59am on the 24th, he came into this world, 12 weeks early. 
        Karen (mum) had been to hell and back, having had major health problems 
        with prancreatitus and gall stone problems, and Ric (dad) was trying to 
        make sure she was well, as well as renovate the house they had recently 
        bought together and work. During the morning of the 24th, she had gone 
        to St. Georges hospital in Tooting to have ECP (the procedure where they 
        put a fiber optic down the throat) to try and crush a gall stone which 
        had been causing mum to be sick for the past two weeks solid.</p>

      <p class="related">The Birth...</p>
      <p>The birth was quick - Karen was in the intensive care unit of Kingston 
        Upon Thames hospital, when she experienced some pains just before midnight. 
        A maternity nurse was on hand, checking the baby, when it was realised 
        that the pains mum was having were contractions. They rushed her to the 
        delivery unit and called dad.</p>
      <p>Luckily we lived at the time in Roehampton, only a few moments from the 
        hospital. By the time I arrived, she was being settled into one of the 
        delivery suites, surrounded by seven nurses and doctors, including three 
        from the Neo natal until, who had arrived together with incubator and 
        other such accouterments...at 00:59am on the 24th, Dylan decided he wanted 
        to check what life is all about, and made a quick entrance. The neonatal 
        doctors quickly worked on him (god bless em) and within momements he was 
        being whisked away. Dad is not ashamed to say that upon seeing his son 
        born, he cried hysterically.</p>
