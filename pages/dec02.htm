      <p class="related">The operation...</p>
      <p>The beginning of December saw Karen have her gall bladder removed at 
        last, although she was quite poorly for a few weeks after. By the time 
        Dylan came home she was well on the way to recovery.....</p>
      <p>Dylan was doing very well, and moved from the <a href="http://www.kingstonhospital.nhs.uk/usefulinfo/maternity.htm#neonatal" class="mainlink" target="_blank">SCBU 
        </a>(the intensive baby care unit) to the next room, and in an open cot 
        instead of an incubator..</p>
      <p class="blktext" align="center">Dylan's beautiful little hands....</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../images/dec02-dylan01.jpg" width="340" height="255" alt="Dylan's hands"></p>
      <p align="left">He was still on assisted breathing, and he was still attempting 
        to remove these tubes at every opportunity...<br>
      </p>

      <p>His milk was upped and he started to look healthier. The other baby Dylan 
        was also here, in the next cot. He had progressed quicker than our Dylan, 
        and was doing well although he was having trouble feeding, something Dylan 
        (probably thanks to having an abundance of his fathers genes) certainly 
        was not!<br>

      <p>Dylan was still have <a href="http://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/childrenshosp/parents_of_preemies/apnea.html" class="mainlink" target="_blank">Bradies 
        and Apneas</a> which was what the nurses were still keeping an eye out 
        for, and why he was still hooked up to the monitoring equipment.... </p>

      <p>The charity that helps raise money for the Neo Natal ward is called <a href="http://www.kingstonhospital.nhs.uk/usefulinfo/neonatal.htm#support" target="_blank" class="mainlink">Born 
        Too Soon</a>, and they sell Christmas cards to help with this. The woman 
        who runs the charity was very helpful, getting parking sorted out for 
        free (it was costing a small fortune) and giving us advise and even free 
        clothes for Dylan (it was very hard to find items so small).</p>
      <p>Before coming home, Dylan was visited by some family and friends, including 
        lola...</p>

      <p class="related">Dylan comes home....</p>
      <p>On December 18th we were told something we never really expected to hear 
        so soon - they were going to let us take home Dylan for Christmas!<br>
      We had to room in the hospital on the 21st and 22nd, which basically 
        meant that we lived for two days in the hospital whilst we looked after 
        Dylan full time. It was a small unremarkable room, with a nasty bed with 
        plastic sheets (I guess they must have a lot of problems with bedwetting 
        parents), but Dylan was as good as gold - sleeping and feeding. Somehow, 
        we did not think it would be as easy as this....</p>

      <p class="related">Christmas Day....</p>
      <p>Dylans first Christmas was spent with his family and Grandma, Grandpa 
        and aunty Donna. It was all a little too much for our Dylan, and he just 
        snoozed his way through the day without a care in the world. As you would 
        expect, lots of presents from friends and family were eagerly opened by 
        mum (more please)...</p>

      <p class="related">Whitstable...</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, back in Whitstable dad, grandpa Tony and Mark had been busy 
        finishing the house. It was not quite ready yet, but we had decided to 
        move on the weekend of the 18th of January, the weekend before dad's 32nd 
        birthday.</p>
