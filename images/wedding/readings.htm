<p><b>The Prophet by Kahil Gibran</b><br>
</p>
<p>Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.<br>
  But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:<br>
  To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.<br>
  To know the pain of too much tenderness.<br>
  To be wounded by your own understanding of love;<br>
  And to bleed willingly and joyfully.<br>
  To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;<br>
  To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;<br>
  To return home at eventide with gratitude;<br>
  And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of 
  praise on your lips. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Kahlil Gibran on Marriage</b></p>
<p>Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of Marriage, Master? <br>
  And he answered saying: <br>
  You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore. <br>
  You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days. <br>
  Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God. <br>
  But let there be spaces in your togetherness, <br>
  And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. </p>
<p>Love one another, but make not a bond of love: <br>
  Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. <br>
  Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. <br>
  Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. <br>
  Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, <br>
  Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. 
</p>
<p>Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. <br>
  For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. <br>
  And stand together yet not too near together: <br>
  For the pillars of the temple stand apart, <br>
  And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow. </p>

<p>Now you will feel no storms,<br>
  for each of you is shelter for the other,</p>
<p>Now you will feel no cold,<br>
  for each of you is warmth to the other,</p>
<p>Now there&#146;s no loneliness,<br>
  for each of you is companion to the other,</p>
<p>You are still two persons,<br>
  and now there is only one life before you.</p>
<p>Go this day to your dwelling place<br>
  and enter into your days together.</p>
<p>May your days be good and long<br>
  upon the earth. <br>
